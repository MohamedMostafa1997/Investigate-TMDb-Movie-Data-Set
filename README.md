# Loan Data Exploration
## by Mohamed mostafa 

### Dataset :
The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, Term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc.

### Summary of Findings :
In the investigation, I found mostly data in normal distribution and 
I found that the borrower APR is correlated with the original loan amount. At a different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR decreases with the increase of loan amount. The borrower's APR also decreases with the increasingly better rating. Interestingly, the relationship between borrower APR and rating turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings are increased from HR to A or better. This is may because people with A or AA ratings tend to borrow more money, I found also that The loan amount is also increased with the increase of loan term. I also found that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amounts. Employed, self-employed, and full-time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired, and not employed borrowers. There is an interaction between categorical terms and Prosper rating features. Proportionally, there are more 60-month loans on B and C ratings. There are only 36 months of loans for HR rating borrowers. 
### Key Insights for Presentation
