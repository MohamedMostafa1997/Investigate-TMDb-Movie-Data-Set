# Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Data-Set
Introduction
I am using TMDb movies dataset. This data set contains information about 10 thousand movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) 
It is possible that some platforms want to show movies to improve their service by showing everyoneâ€™s favorite movie, 
such as (recommendation system) or a production company wants to improve the level of its movies by showing the best movies to people,
so I want to put some analyzes on this project for these purposes,

Questions
